TA Signals is an iOS app developed in SwiftUI as a learning exercise. 

It fetches stock market data and indicators from a JSON endpoint and display the data neatly organized on-screen.

Where does data come from? 

At the moment the data is static and can be found here: https://github.com/iamgabrielma/Python-for-stock-market-analysis/tree/main/testData . This will be edited soon and data will be fetched from the same script recurrently via a cron job.

Disclaimer: Nothing in the app and/or site constitutes professional and/or financial advice. All the data and indicators are provided for educational purposes only.
